- **Technical Debt**: 
  - No caching layer for frequently accessed entities
  - Database queries in hot paths (CheckBaseData, command execution)
  - Potential N+1 query issues in entity relationships
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Sequelize v6.29.1, Node.js 18.18.2, MySQL 2
  - better-sqlite3 (for existing NoSQL implementation)
  - node-cache or similar for in-memory caching
- **Constraints**:

## Architecture & Design

### System Architecture
- **Component Diagram**: 
  ```
  SQLWrapper.js (Enhanced)
  ├── CacheManager (New)
  │   ├── MemoryCache (node-cache)
  │   ├── PersistentCache (SQLite)
  │   └── CacheInvalidator
  ├── Enhanced SQLDataHelper (Modified)
  │   ├── Cached CRUD operations
  │   └── Cache-aware relationship loading
  └── Enhanced SQLBase (Modified)
      ├── Cache configuration
      └── Connection pooling optimization
  ```
- **Data Flow**: 
  1. Application requests entity → CacheManager checks memory cache
  2. Cache miss → Check persistent cache → Database query
  3. Cache hit → Return cached data with validation
  4. Write operations → Update database → Invalidate related cache entries
- **Integration Points**: 
  - SQLWrapper.js exports enhanced with cache methods
  - SQLDataHelper.js enhanced with cached versions of existing methods
  - Logger integration for cache monitoring and debugging
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - node-cache for in-memory caching
  - better-sqlite3 for persistent cache (leveraging existing NoSQL infrastructure)
  - Existing Sequelize models and relationships

### Database Design
- **Schema Changes**: 
  - New cache database: `app_data/db/cache.db`
  - Tables: `entity_cache`, `cache_metadata`, `invalidation_log`
- **Data Migration**: 
  - No migration needed - cache is populated on-demand
  - Cache warming strategies for production deployment
- **Performance Considerations**: 
  - Separate SQLite database for cache to avoid contention
  - Indexed cache keys for fast lookups
  - Automatic cleanup of expired entries

### API Design
- **Enhanced Methods**: 
  ```javascript
  // Existing methods remain unchanged
  User.findByPk(id) // Now cached automatically
  
  // New cached methods
  getUserCached(userId, ttl)
  getGuildCached(guildId, ttl)
  getUserProfilesCached(userId, ttl)
  invalidateUserCache(userId)
  clearAllCache()
  getCacheStatistics()
  ```
- **Request/Response Formats**: 
  - Identical to existing Sequelize model responses
  - Additional metadata for cache debugging (development mode only)
- **Versioning Strategy**: 
  - No API versioning needed - transparent enhancement
  - Internal cache versioning using entity timestamps

# Implementation Plan: NoSQL Database Logging Migration

## Executive Summary
- **Objective**: Migrate the current MySQL-based logging system to a disk-based NoSQL solution that can handle organic log growth more efficiently
- **Impact**: Improved logging performance, reduced MySQL database overhead, better scalability for high-volume logging operations
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for complete migration and testing
- **Risk Level**: Medium - Critical system refactoring affecting core logging infrastructure

## Project Overview

### Existing Plans Analysis
- **Current Pipeline**: Two existing plans for command documentation and DM message deletion
- **Related Plans**: No direct conflicts, but the DM message deletion plan includes LogReaction functionality that will be affected by this migration
- **Dependencies on Existing Plans**: This migration should be completed before or in parallel with the DM message deletion plan to avoid rework
- **Lessons Learned**: The project has established patterns for logging levels, error handling, and database synchronization that should be preserved in the new system

### Current State Analysis
- **Architecture Overview**: 
  - Comprehensive 3-tier logging system (Console, File, Database)
  - Four log entity types: LogApplication, LogMessage, LogDM, LogReaction
  - MySQL-based storage with Sequelize ORM relationships
  - Integration with User, Guild, Channel entities via foreign keys
  - Log level filtering and environment-based output control
- **Technical Debt**: 
  - MySQL logging creates overhead for high-frequency operations
  - Log tables grow organically and may impact MySQL performance
  - Complex foreign key relationships for logging data that's primarily archival
  - LogCommand and LogButton entities partially implemented but not used
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Current MySQL connection via Sequelize ORM
  - Existing file-based logging in `app_data/logs/`
  - LogHelper utilities for level validation and date formatting
  - Integration with Discord.js message contexts
- **Constraints**: 
  - Must maintain existing logging API compatibility
  - Must preserve log level filtering functionality
  - Must support both development and production environments
  - Must handle Windows/Linux path differences

## Architecture & Design

### System Architecture
- **Component Diagram**: 
  - `LogNoSQL.js` - New NoSQL logging implementation replacing `LogDB.js`
  - `NoSQLBase.js` - SQLite connection management (similar to `SQLBase.js`)
  - `NoSQLController.js` - Main database operations controller
  - Modified `Logger.js` - Updated to use NoSQL instead of MySQL for database logging
  - Preserved `LogConsole.js` and `LogFile.js` - No changes to existing file/console logging
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Logger.js receives log request → LogNoSQL.js processes and stores → SQLite database in app_data/db/
  - Fallback to LogFile.js on NoSQL errors (same as current MySQL fallback)
  - Console logging remains unchanged for development environment
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Maintain existing Logger.js API compatibility
  - Integration with LogHelper for level validation and date formatting
  - Error handling integration with file-based logging fallback
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - SQLite for disk-based storage (better-sqlite3 npm package)
  - Node.js fs module for directory management
  - Existing LogLevel, LogStatus, LogType enumerations

### Database Design
- **Schema Changes**: 
  - Convert Sequelize entities to SQLite table schemas
  - Remove foreign key constraints to User, Guild, Channel (store IDs as simple values)
  - Add database-level indexes for common query patterns
  - Implement log rotation and cleanup mechanisms
- **Data Migration**: 
  - No automated migration from MySQL (new system starts fresh)
  - Existing MySQL logs remain available for historical reference
  - Documentation for manual data export if needed
- **Performance Considerations**: 
  - Separate SQLite databases for each log type (log_application.db, log_message.db, etc.)
  - Date-based partitioning for large log volumes
  - Efficient indexing on timestamp, level, and source columns
  - Write-ahead logging (WAL) mode for better concurrent performance

# Implementation Plan: DM Message Deletion via ❌ Reaction

## Executive Summary
- **Objective**: Implement the ability for the bot to delete its own messages in direct messages when users react with ❌
- **Impact**: Improved user experience by allowing users to clean up DM conversations with the bot
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for complete implementation and testing
- **Risk Level**: Low - Simple feature addition with minimal system impact

## Project Overview

### Existing Plans Analysis
- **Current Pipeline**: No existing plans found in `.github/plans` directory
- **Related Plans**: None identified that would conflict with this implementation
- **Dependencies on Existing Plans**: None
- **Lessons Learned**: N/A (first plan in repository)

### Current State Analysis
- **Architecture Overview**: 
  - Bot has existing reaction handling system in `ReactionHandler.js`
  - Current system only handles guild message reactions for war scheduling
  - Discord client configured with `DirectMessageReactions` intent
  - Comprehensive logging system in place
- **Technical Debt**: 
  - Reaction handler only supports guild channel reactions currently
  - Missing DM reaction handling logic
  - Incomplete `LogReaction` implementations in logging system
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Discord.js v14.13.0 with reaction handling capabilities
  - Existing logging infrastructure
  - Bot permissions for DM operations
- **Constraints**: 
  - Bot can only delete its own messages
  - Feature limited to direct message channels only
  - Must respect Discord API rate limits

### Requirements Specification

#### Functional Requirements
- [REQ-F001]: Bot must detect ❌ reactions on its own messages in direct message channels
- [REQ-F002]: Bot must delete the message when ❌ reaction is added by the message recipient
- [REQ-F003]: Bot must ignore ❌ reactions from other users (should not occur in DMs but safety check)
- [REQ-F004]: Bot must ignore ❌ reactions on messages from other bots or users
- [REQ-F005]: Bot must handle partial reaction objects appropriately

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- [REQ-NF001]: Response time for message deletion should be under 2 seconds
- [REQ-NF002]: Feature must not impact existing guild reaction functionality
- [REQ-NF003]: Must include comprehensive error handling and logging

- [REQ-T002]: Add logging for DM reaction events using existing logging infrastructure
- [REQ-T003]: Ensure feature works with partial reaction objects
- [REQ-T004]: Maintain existing code patterns and architecture

## Architecture & Design

### System Architecture
- **Component Diagram**: Extend existing `ReactionHandler.js` with DM reaction logic branch
- **Data Flow**: 
  1. User reacts with ❌ to bot message in DM
  2. Discord fires `MessageReactionAdd` event
  3. `ReactionHandler.handleReactions` receives event
  4. New DM branch validates reaction and conditions
  5. Bot deletes message using Discord.js `message.delete()`
  6. Action logged via existing logging system
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Discord.js reaction event system
  - Existing logging infrastructure (`LogReaction`)
  - Error handling via try/catch blocks
- **Technology Stack**: No new technologies required

### Database Design
- **Schema Changes**: None required
- **Data Migration**: Not applicable
- **Performance Considerations**: No database operations involved

### API Design
- **Endpoints**: Not applicable (internal feature)
- **Request/Response Formats**: Uses Discord.js message objects
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Handled by Discord.js client permissions
- **Versioning Strategy**: Not applicable

### B. Alternative Approaches
- **Slash Command Approach**: Could add `/delete` command but reactions are more intuitive
- **Time-based Deletion**: Could auto-delete after time period but user control is better
- **Multiple Emoji Support**: Could support other deletion emojis but ❌ is most intuitive

### C. Reference Architecture
- **Existing Guild Reactions**: Pattern established in current `ReactionHandler.js`
- **Logging Patterns**: Consistent with existing logging infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Follows established patterns in codebase

### D. Glossary
- **DM**: Direct Message - private message channel between user and bot
- **Reaction**: Discord emoji response added to a message
- **Partial Object**: Discord.js object that needs to be fetched for complete data
- **❌**: Cross mark emoji (U+274C) used as deletion trigger

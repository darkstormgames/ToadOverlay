# DM Message Deletion Feature - Test Plan

## Test Summary
This test plan validates the implementation of the DM message deletion feature via ‚ùå reaction in ToadOverlay Discord bot.

## Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Features Implemented
1. **DM Message Deletion**: Users can react with ‚ùå to bot messages in DMs to delete them
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive reaction logging for debugging and monitoring
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for edge cases
4. **User Documentation**: Updated help system to inform users about the feature

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic DM Message Deletion
**Objective**: Verify that users can delete bot messages in DMs using ‚ùå reaction
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running, user has overlay setup
**Steps**:
1. Send DM to bot (e.g., type "help")
2. Bot responds with help message
3. React to bot's message with ‚ùå emoji
4. Verify message is deleted

**Expected Result**: Bot message is successfully deleted
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 2: Partial Reaction Handling
**Objective**: Verify that partial reactions are handled correctly
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running, older messages in DM
**Steps**:
1. Find an old bot message in DM
2. React with ‚ùå emoji
3. Verify message is deleted even if reaction is partial

**Expected Result**: Message is deleted after fetching partial reaction
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 3: Error Handling - Already Deleted Message
**Objective**: Verify graceful handling when message is already deleted
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running
**Steps**:
1. Send DM to bot
2. React with ‚ùå quickly
3. If possible, manually delete message before bot processes reaction
4. Check logs for proper error handling

**Expected Result**: Error is logged but doesn't crash bot
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 4: Guild vs DM Context
**Objective**: Verify feature only works in DMs, not in guild channels
**Prerequisites**: Bot is in a guild channel
**Steps**:
1. Use bot command in guild channel
2. React with ‚ùå to bot message
3. Verify message is NOT deleted (should only handle war scheduling reactions)

**Expected Result**: Message is not deleted, only war scheduling logic applies
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 5: Non-Bot Message Reactions
**Objective**: Verify bot ignores reactions on non-bot messages
**Prerequisites**: DM conversation with bot
**Steps**:
1. Send user message in DM
2. React with ‚ùå to your own message
3. Verify bot doesn't attempt to delete it

**Expected Result**: Bot ignores reaction on user message
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 6: Wrong Emoji Reactions
**Objective**: Verify bot only responds to ‚ùå emoji in DMs
**Prerequisites**: DM conversation with bot
**Steps**:
1. Send DM to bot to get response
2. React with different emoji (e.g., ‚úÖ, üòÄ, üëç)
3. Verify message is not deleted

**Expected Result**: Bot ignores non-‚ùå reactions in DMs
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 7: Logging Verification
**Objective**: Verify all reaction events are properly logged
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running, logging is enabled
**Steps**:
1. Perform various reaction scenarios
2. Check application logs for LogReaction entries
3. Verify database contains reaction log entries

**Expected Result**: All reactions are logged with appropriate details
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 8: Help Documentation
**Objective**: Verify users are informed about the feature
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running
**Steps**:
1. Send "help" in DM to bot
2. Check help pages for information about ‚ùå reaction feature
3. Verify information is clear and accurate

**Expected Result**: Help documentation mentions ‚ùå reaction deletion feature
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and ready for testing

## Performance Tests

### Test Case 9: Rate Limiting
**Objective**: Verify feature respects Discord API rate limits
**Prerequisites**: Bot is running
**Steps**:
1. Create multiple bot messages quickly
2. React to all with ‚ùå rapidly
3. Monitor for rate limit errors

**Expected Result**: No rate limit errors, all messages deleted successfully
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 10: Concurrent Reactions
**Objective**: Verify handling of multiple simultaneous reactions
**Prerequisites**: Multiple bot messages in DM
**Steps**:
1. React to multiple messages with ‚ùå simultaneously
2. Verify all messages are deleted
3. Check logs for proper handling

**Expected Result**: All messages deleted, no errors in logs
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

## Security Tests

### Test Case 11: Permission Verification
**Objective**: Verify bot only deletes its own messages
**Prerequisites**: DM conversation with multiple message types
**Steps**:
1. Ensure DM contains bot messages and user messages
2. React with ‚ùå to various message types
3. Verify only bot messages are deleted

**Expected Result**: Only bot's own messages are deleted
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing

### Test Case 12: User Validation
**Objective**: Verify only the DM recipient can delete messages
**Prerequisites**: This is difficult to test directly due to DM nature
**Steps**:
1. Code review to verify user validation logic
2. Check that reaction.message.author.id == reaction.client.user.id
3. Verify user.id != reaction.client.user.id check

**Expected Result**: Only proper user can trigger deletion
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented correctly

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
- `ENVIRONMENT=DEVELOPMENT` (for console logging)
- `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG` (for detailed logging)
- Discord bot token and permissions
- Database connection for log storage

### Required Bot Permissions

- `DirectMessageReactions` intent
- `Message` partial
- `Reaction` partial
- `User` partial
